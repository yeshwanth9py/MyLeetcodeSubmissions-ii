# Maximum Area of Two Non-Overlapping Square Submatrices

Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Area of Two Non-Overlapping Square Submatrices - You are given a 2D integer matrix mat of size m × n, where:

 * mat[r][c] == 1 means the cell at row r and column c is usable.
 * mat[r][c] == 0 means it is not usable.

Your task is to find two submatrices that satisfy the following conditions:

 * Both submatrices must be squares of the same side length k.
 * The two submatrices must not share any cell.
 * Each submatrix can only cover cells where mat[r][c] == 1.

Return the maximum possible area of each of the two squares. If it is not possible to choose two such squares, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The largest equal non-overlapping squares have side length k = 2 with area 4.

 * First square starts at top-left (0, 0) and covers cells (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).
 * Second square starts at top-left (1, 2) and covers cells (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

Thus, the answer is 4.

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The largest equal non-overlapping squares have side length k = 1 with area 1.

 * First square starts at top-left (0, 1) and covers cell (0, 1).
 * Second square starts at top-left (1, 0) and covers cell (1, 0).

Thus, the answer is 1.

Example 3:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/06/13/screenshot-2026-06-13-at-83751pm.png]

Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

There is only one usable cell, so it is impossible to choose two non-overlapping squares. Thus, the answer is 0.
