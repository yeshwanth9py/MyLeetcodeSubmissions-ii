# Surrounded Regions

Can you solve this real interview question? Surrounded Regions - You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

 * Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
 * Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
 * Surround: A region is surrounded if none of the 'O' cells in that region are on the edge of the board. Such regions are completely enclosed by 'X' cells.

To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

 

Example 1:

Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

Example 2:

Input: board = [["X"]]

Output: [["X"]]
