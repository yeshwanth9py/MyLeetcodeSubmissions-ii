# Create Grid With Exactly K Paths I

Can you solve this real interview question? Create Grid With Exactly K Paths I - You are given three integers m, n, and k.

Construct any m x n grid consisting only of the characters '.' and '#', where:

 * '.' represents a free cell.
 * '#' represents an obstacle cell.

A valid path is a sequence of free cells that:

 * Starts at the top-left cell (0, 0).
 * Ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).
 * Moves only:
   * Right, from (i, j) to (i, j + 1), or
   * Down, from (i, j) to (i + 1, j).

Return any grid such that there are exactly k valid paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. If no such grid exists, return an empty array.

 

Example 1:

Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 2

Output: ["...","#.."]

There are exactly k = 2 valid paths from (0, 0) to (1, 2):

 * (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2)
 * (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2)

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 4

Output: ["..#","...","#.."]

Explanation:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/05/26/screenshot-2026-05-27-at-113452am.png]

There are exactly k = 4 valid paths from (0, 0) to (2, 2):

 * (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2)
 * (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2)
 * (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2)
 * (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2)

Example 3:

Input: m = 1, n = 4, k = 2

Output: []

Explanation:

No grid exists with exactly k = 2 valid paths for a 1 x 4 grid, so the answer is an empty array.
