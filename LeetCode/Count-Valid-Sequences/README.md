# Count Valid Sequences

Can you solve this real interview question? Count Valid Sequences - You are given two positive integers n and k.

A valid sequence is a sequence of k positive integers such that:

 * The sum of all integers in the sequence is equal to n.
 * The product of all integers in the sequence is even.

Return the number of valid sequences. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Two sequences are considered different if they differ at any index. For example, [1, 1, 2] and [1, 2, 1] are considered different sequences.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

The sequences of length k = 3 whose sum is 5 are:

Sequence Product Parity [1, 1, 3] 1 * 1 * 3 = 3 Odd [1, 2, 2] 1 * 2 * 2 = 4 Even [2, 1, 2] 2 * 1 * 2 = 4 Even [2, 2, 1] 2 * 2 * 1 = 4 Even [1, 3, 1] 1 * 3 * 1 = 3 Odd [3, 1, 1] 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 Odd

There are 3 sequences with an even product, thus the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The sequences of length k = 2 whose sum is 3 are:

Sequence Product Parity [1, 2] 1 * 2 = 2 Even [2, 1] 2 * 1 = 2 Even

There are 2 sequences with an even product, thus the answer is 2.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, k = 5

Output: 0

Explanation:

The only possible sequence of length k = 5 whose sum is 5 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has an odd product. Thus, the answer is 0.
