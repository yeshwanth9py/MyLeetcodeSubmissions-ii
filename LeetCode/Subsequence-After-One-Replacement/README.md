# Subsequence After One Replacement

Can you solve this real interview question? Subsequence After One Replacement - You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase English letters.

You may choose at most one index in s and replace the character at that index with any lowercase English letter.

Return true if it is possible to make s a subsequence of t; otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cat", t = "chat"

Output: true

Explanation:

 * Replace s[1] from 'a' to 'h'. The resulting string is "cht".
 * "cht" is a subsequence of "chat" because we can match 'c', 'h', and 't' in order.

Example 2:

Input: s = "plane", t = "apple"

Output: false

Explanation:

 * The characters 'p', 'l', and 'e' can be matched in t, but the remaining characters cannot be matched while preserving the required order.
 * Even after replacing any one character in s, it is impossible to make s a subsequence of t.
