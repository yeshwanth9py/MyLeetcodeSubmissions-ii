# Peaks in Array II

Can you solve this real interview question? Peaks in Array II - You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D integer array queries.

A subarray nums[i..j] is called a peak subarray if:

 * Its length is at least 3.
 * There exists an index k such that i < k < j and:
   * nums[k] > nums[k - 1]
   * nums[k] > nums[k + 1]

You have to process queries of two types:

 * [1, li, ri]: Calculate the number of peak subarrays fully contained within nums[li..ri].
 * [2, indexi, vali]: Update nums[indexi] to vali. This update applies to all subsequent queries.

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query of type 1 in the order they appear.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,4], queries = [[1,0,3],[2,1,1],[1,0,3]]

Output: [2,0]

Explanation:

 * Query [1, 0, 3]:
   * [1, 3, 2]: choose k = 1. Then nums[k] = 3, nums[k - 1] = 1, and nums[k + 1] = 2. Since 3 > 1 and 3 > 2, this is a peak subarray.
   * [1, 3, 2, 4]: choose k = 1. Then nums[k] = 3, nums[k - 1] = 1, and nums[k + 1] = 2. Since 3 > 1 and 3 > 2, this is a peak subarray.
 * Query [2, 1, 1]: Update nums[1] to 1. The array becomes [1, 1, 2, 4].
 * Query [1, 0, 3]: There are no peak subarrays now.
 * Thus, answer = [2, 0].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,8,9,8], queries = [[1,1,3],[2,2,1],[1,0,2]]

Output: [1,0]

Explanation:

 * Query [1, 1, 3]:
   * nums[1..3] = [8, 9, 8]: choose k = 2. Then nums[k] = 9, nums[k - 1] = 8, and nums[k + 1] = 8. Since 9 > 8 and 9 > 8, this is a peak subarray.
 * Query [2, 2, 1]: Update nums[2] to 1. The array becomes [9, 8, 1, 8].
 * Query [1, 0, 2]: There are no peak subarrays.
 * Thus, answer = [1, 0].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,6,2,7,1], queries = [[1,1,3],[2,3,0],[1,0,4]]

Output: [0,3]

Explanation:

 * Query [1, 1, 3]: The only subarray of length at least 3 is [6, 2, 7]. Its only possible peak index is k = 2, but nums[2] = 2 is less than both nums[1] = 6 and nums[3] = 7, so it is not a peak subarray.
 * Query [2, 3, 0]: Update nums[3] to 0. The array becomes [3, 6, 2, 0, 1].
 * Query [1, 0, 4]:
   * [3, 6, 2]: choose k = 1. Then nums[k] = 6, nums[k - 1] = 3, and nums[k + 1] = 2. Since 6 > 3 and 6 > 2, this is a peak subarray.
   * [3, 6, 2, 0]: choose k = 1. Then nums[k] = 6, nums[k - 1] = 3, and nums[k + 1] = 2. Since 6 > 3 and 6 > 2, this is a peak subarray.
   * [3, 6, 2, 0, 1]: choose k = 1. Then nums[k] = 6, nums[k - 1] = 3, and nums[k + 1] = 2. Since 6 > 3 and 6 > 2, this is a peak subarray.
 * Thus, answer = [0, 3].
