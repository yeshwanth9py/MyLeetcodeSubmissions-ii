# Count Good Cyclic Rotations

Can you solve this real interview question? Count Good Cyclic Rotations - You are given an integer array nums of even length n.

A cyclic rotation of nums is obtained by choosing a prefix of nums whose length is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the array while preserving the order of all elements.

A cyclic rotation is good if the sum of its first n / 2 elements is strictly greater than the sum of its last n / 2 elements.

Return the number of cyclic rotations of nums that are good.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The cyclic rotations of nums are:

Cyclic rotation Sum of first n / 2 elements Sum of last n / 2 elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1] 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2] 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 6 + 1 + 2 = 9 [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3] 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4] 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 6 + 1 + 2 = 9 3 + 4 + 5 = 12

The first half has a greater sum than the second half for 3 rotations. Thus, the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2]

Output: 0

Explanation:

The cyclic rotations of nums are:

Cyclic rotation Sum of first n / 2 elements Sum of last n / 2 elements [1, 2, 1, 2] 1 + 2 = 3 1 + 2 = 3 [2, 1, 2, 1] 2 + 1 = 3 2 + 1 = 3 [1, 2, 1, 2] 1 + 2 = 3 1 + 2 = 3 [2, 1, 2, 1] 2 + 1 = 3 2 + 1 = 3

No cyclic rotation is good because the two sums are equal for every rotation. Thus, the answer is 0.
