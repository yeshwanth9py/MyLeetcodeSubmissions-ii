# Elevator Requests III

Can you solve this real interview question? Elevator Requests III - You are given an integer n denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given an integer start and a 2D integer array requests, where requests[i] = [arrivali, floori] indicates that a request for floori is made at time arrivali.

At time 0, the elevator is at floor start.

At each second, the elevator may move up by 1 floor, move down by 1 floor, or remain on its current floor.

A request can be fulfilled only at or after its arrival time; it is fulfilled instantly when the elevator is on its requested floor at any time from its arrival time onward.

Return the minimum time needed to fulfill all requests.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 9, start = 0, requests = [[0,8],[6,5]]

Output: 9

Explanation:

 * Move from floor 0 (start) to floor 5 (requests[1][1]) in 5 seconds, reaching at time 5. Since requests[1][0] = 6, wait until time 6 to fulfill it.
 * Move from floor 5 to floor 8 (requests[0][1]) in 3 seconds, fulfilling it at time 9.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 9.

Example 2:

Input: n = 8, start = 5, requests = [[1,7],[7,3]]

Output: 7

Explanation:

 * Move from floor 5 (start) to floor 7 (requests[0][1]) in 2 seconds, reaching at time 2. Since requests[0][0] = 1 has already passed, floor 7 is fulfilled at time 2.
 * Move from floor 7 to floor 3 (requests[1][1]) in 4 seconds, reaching at time 6. Since requests[1][0] = 7, wait until time 7.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 7.

Example 3:

Input: n = 7, start = 3, requests = [[0,5],[0,1],[6,3]]

Output: 8

Explanation:

 * Move from floor 3 (start) to floor 5 (requests[0][1]) in 2 seconds, fulfilling it at time 2.
 * Move from floor 5 to floor 1 (requests[1][1]) in 4 seconds, fulfilling it at time 6.
 * Move from floor 1 to floor 3 (requests[2][1]) in 2 seconds, reaching at time 8. Its request arrived at requests[2][0] = 6, so floor 3 is fulfilled at time 8.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 8.
