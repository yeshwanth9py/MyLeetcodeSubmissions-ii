# Even Number of Knight Moves

Can you solve this real interview question? Even Number of Knight Moves - You are given two integer arrays start and target, where each array is of the form [x, y] representing a cell on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard.

Return true if a knight can move from start to target in an even number of moves. Otherwise, return false.

Note: A valid knight move consists of moving two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to it. The figure below illustrates all eight possible moves from a cell.

Example 1:

Input: start = [1,1], target = [2,2]

Output: true

Explanation:

One possible sequence of moves is (1, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (2, 2).

The knight reaches the target in 4 moves, which is even. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: start = [4,5], target = [6,6]

Output: false

Explanation:

It is impossible to reach target = [6, 6] from start = [4, 5] in an even number of moves. Thus, the answer is false.
